# Cantacazino

This project came into my mind after visiting Cantacuzino Castle in Busteni (https://www.cantacuzinocastle.com/) last summer. There were some jokes around me, changing the name "Cantacuzino" into "Cantacasino" and I thought that would be a nice idea for new project. :)

## How does it work?

It is basically an online casino, where you can bet in different games, trying to get more and more profit. Because this casino doesn't use real money, I just used as currency the Cryptonut virtual coin. Every new user starts with 1000 Cryptonut, but the player can increase that amount or in the bad case scenario to go bankrupt. But don't worry! Because in the main page if you press on the currency you will go back to 1000 Cryptonut :)
Go enjoy using infinite credits.

## What have I learnt / used?

Last summer I found out about Google Firebase and I tried to learn it. I used their Realtime Database, for keeping track of the user's current amount of credits and their Authentication for creating a new user and then to log in.
So far, I only have 6 games, but I plan to add more of them. My current goal can be found below, at the TODO section


## Current TODO:
- Find some good designs for thumbnails / backgrounds
- Add more games
- Make them "less random"
- Add the header for "Hot Spinning" :)
